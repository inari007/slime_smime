SLIME S/MIME

Plugin to provide security via S/MIME 4.0 standard (RFC 8551).

Plugin stores all data safely on the server therefore requires user
to trust the server. This approach violates end-to-end principle but
allows easier usage. 

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Roundcube version 1.6.0+
- OpenSSL version 3+

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Set configuration in config.inc.php.dist and preferably
   create a new directory for storing the certificates.
2. Ensure that directory for certificates is writable.  
3. Rename it to config.inc.php.

TODO
----

- Client side signing (selectable) -> enable not to store private keys on the server
- Import certificate from a signature  
- Certificate credibility levels when verifying certificates
- Be able to select different imported certificate for encrypting/signing 
- Import/Export/Deletion of multiple certificates at the same time
- Changing password changes password hash (Somehow try to fix that)
- Compression of the content before signing or encrypting (CompressionData)
- Enable to secure PK in PKCS#12 with an additional layer via security phrase
